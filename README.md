# ScrumLab

This is a repository dedicated to ScrumLab front-end project we were working on during bootcamp, in the middle of a course. We had 4 days to create it.

The point of a project wasn't to deliver fully functional product, but rather familiarize ourselves with Scrum and GitFlow metodology, as well as with coding in a team and dealing with conflicts and so on.
After deadline, project was abandoned in state as it is, due to other projects and further course of a classes. But maybye we will pick it up one day.

Original readme below.

## How to start
To start development follow this instruction:

* `clone` this repo
* `npm install` all necessary npm packages


## Gulp usage
Avaliable commends for you to type in console:

`gulp` or `gulp serve`  - this will run gulp in browserSync mode, that means gulp will start serwer on your `localhost` and refresh it for you everytime you change `scss`, `js` or `html` file. Using this command will do all the work for you :)

`gulp watch` - runs gulp in watch mode, that will compiles your `main.scss` into `css/main.css`

`gulp sass` - compiles sass into CSS & auto-inject into browsers
